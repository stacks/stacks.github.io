  <h1 class="page-heading" id="what">What is it?</h1>

  <p>This will be a workshop in Algebraic Geometry. The intended participant (you) is a graduate student, or a post-doc, or even a senior researcher. Roughly the idea is that you will learn about and work on a single topic in a small group together with a mentor for a week with the aim of producing a text that will be considered for inclusion in the <a href="http://stacks.math.columbia.edu">Stacks&nbsp;project</a>. Part of this process will be seeing how one builds new theory from the foundations. There will also be some talks each day covering advanced topics in algebraic geometry.

  <p>The Stacks project workshop will have some optional activities you won't see at other workshops. Adding references to and finding mistakes in the Stacks project (and fixing them) as well as activities related to the use of LaTeX, <a href="http://git-scm.com">Git</a>, and <a href="http://github.org">GitHub</a>. Overall these will be aimed at helping you contribute efficiently to the Stacks project.

  <p>For those who are interested, we will also discuss how it is possible to contribute to the <em>software</em> that runs the Stacks&nbsp;project.
