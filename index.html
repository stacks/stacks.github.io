  <h1 class="page-heading">What is it?</h1>
  <p>There are two goals for this workshop: first of all it is a workshop in the usual sense of the word, in this case centered around the topic of <em>algebraic stacks</em>. You will work on a single topic in a small group together with a mentor for a week.

  <p>The second goal is to learn how to <em>contribute</em> to the <a href="http://stacks.math.columbia.edu">Stacks&nbsp;project</a>. You will learn how to use <a href="http://git-scm.com">Git</a> and <a href="http://github.org">GitHub</a>, and you will learn how to make sure your LaTeX is compatible with the system that the Stacks&nbsp;project uses. The topics discussed at the workshop can form the basis for a new chapter of the Stacks&nbsp;project, one for which you will be the co-author.

  <p>For those who are interested, we will also discuss how it is possible to contribute to the <em>software</em> that runs the Stacks&nbsp;project.
