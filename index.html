  <h1 class="page-heading" id="about">About</h1>

  <p>I am a Mathematician. Topology and Galois theory have played parallel roles in the generalisation of Algebraic geometry, namely, the unification of Arithmetic and Geometry. I study the Topology that is Galois theory in Arithmetic geometry.

    <li><a href="https://github.com/MateoCarmonaGom/LaLongueMarche">La longue marche a travers la theorie de Galois</a>, These files form a LaTeX-version of Grothendieck's (part I #1-37) La Longue Marche a Travers la Theorie de Galois. <em>This manuscript, consisting of some nearly 800 hand-written double pages, dating from 1981, was left behind with Grothendieck's other unpublished manuscripts when he disappeared in 1991. It goes together with a further 1000 pages or so of additional notes and sections which have not yet been read or typed.</em>
    <li><a href="https://github.com/MateoCarmonaGom/EnGuisedeProgramme">En Guise de Programme</a>, Grothendieck was planning to give a course called “Introduction to research” for the fourth year students, and in October 1978 he prepared an information sheet for the class entitled "En Guise de Programme". This project is intended to make available a TeX version of the "sheet" and some translations.

    <p>Your idea of writing a “frantically speculative” article on groupoids seems to me a  very  good  one.   It  is  the  kind  of  thing  which  has  traditionally  been  lacking  in mathematics since the very beginnings, I feel, which is one big drawback in comparison to all other sciences, as far as I know.  Of course, no creative mathematician can afford not to “speculate”, namely to do more or less daring guesswork as an indispensable source of inspiration.  The trouble is that, in obedience to a stern tradition, almost nothing of this appears in writing, and preciously little even in oral communication. The point is that the disrepute of “speculation” or “dream” is such, that even as a strictly  private  (not  to  say  secret!)   activity,  it  has  a  tendency  to  vegetate  –  much like the desire and drive of love and sex, in too repressive an environment.  Despite the “repression”, in the one or two years before I unexpectedly was led to withdraw from the mathematical milieu and to stop publishing, it was more or less clear to me that, besides going on pushing ahead with foundational work in SGA and EGA, I was going to write a wholly science-fiction kind of book on “motives”, which was then the most fascinating and mysterious mathematical being I had come to meet so far.  As my interests and my emphasis have somewhat shifted since, I doubt I am ever going to write this book – still less anyone else is going to,  presumably.  But whatever I am going to write in mathematics, I believe a major part of it will be “speculation” or “fiction”,  going hand in hand with painstaking,  down-to-earth work to get hold of  the  right  kind  of  notions  and  structures,  to  work  out  comprehensive  pictures  of still  misty  landscapes.   The  notes  I  am  writing  up  lately  are  in  this  spirit,  but  in this case the landscape isn’t so remote really,  and the feeling is rather that,  as for the specific program I have been out for is concerned, getting everything straight and clear shouldn’t mean more than a few years work at most for someone who really feels like doing it, maybe less.  But of course surprises are bound to turn up on one’s way, and while starting with a few threads in hand, after a while they may have multiplied and become such a bunch that you cannot possibly grasp them all, let alone follow. <b>Lettre d’Alexandre Grothendieck `a Ronald Brown, 14.06.1983</b>

    <p>Maybe at times I like to give the impression, to myself and hence others, that I am the easy learner of things of life, wholly relaxed, "cool" and all that - just keen for learning, for eating the meal and welcome smilingly whatever comes with its message, frustration and sorrow and destructiveness and the softer dishes alike. This of course is just humbug, an image d'Épinal which at whiles I'll kid myself into believing I am like.Truth is that I am a hard learner, maybe as hard and reluctant as anyone. <b>140 The meal and the guest.
