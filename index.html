  <p>I am a Mathematician. The intended participant (you) is a graduate student, or a post-doc, or even a senior researcher. Roughly the idea is that you will learn about and work on a single topic in a small group together with a mentor for a week with the aim of producing a text that will be considered for inclusion in the <a href="http://stacks.math.columbia.edu">Stacks&nbsp;project</a>. Part of this process will be seeing how one builds new theory from the foundations. There will also be some talks each day covering advanced topics in algebraic geometry.

    <li><a href="https://github.com/MateoCarmonaGom/LaLongueMarche">La longue marche a travers la theorie de Galois</a>, These files form a LaTeX-version of Grothendieck's (part I #1-37) La Longue Marche a Travers la Theorie de Galois. <em>This manuscript, consisting of some nearly 800 hand-written double pages, dating from 1981, was left behind with Grothendieck's other unpublished manuscripts when he disappeared in 1991. It goes together with a further 1000 pages or so of additional notes and sections which have not yet been read or typed.</em>
