  <h1 class="page-heading" id="what">What is it?</h1>

  <p>This will be a workshop in Algebraic Geometry, in topics (tangentially) related to the Stacks project.

  <p>The participants who apply and are accepted will be graduate students, post-docs, or even senior researchers.
  Roughly the idea is that they will learn about and work on a single topic in a small group together with a mentor for a week.
  Part of this process will be seeing how one builds new theory from the foundations.

  <!--
  <p>At least morally one can think of the process a text that will be considered for inclusion in the <a href="http://stacks.math.columbia.edu">Stacks&nbsp;project</a>
  or a possible second volume of <a href="/spec.html">Stacks Project Expository Collection</a>.
  -->

  <p>There will also be some talks each day covering advanced topics in algebraic geometry.
  Mathematicians not in the groups are welcome to come to these talks.

  <!--
  <p>You must <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfV6Se-X9RmLrdkF9z63GO2q0E5P-BSy3kzfBrbZtPkRaghuQ/viewform"><strong>apply</strong> to be a participant</a>,
  the deadline is <strong>February 15, 2023</strong>.
  When accepted, you will be asked about your preferences for a mentor and topic (to be announced later).
