<h2>Abstracts</h2>
<section id="gould">
  <h3 class="title">Higher rank Brill-Noether theory for \(\mathbb{P}^2\), and related questions</h3>
  <p class="speaker"><span class="name">Ben Gould</span> (<span class="affiliation">University of Michigan</span>)
  <blockquote>
    Brill-Noether theory for stable vector bundles is the study of the loci inside moduli spaces of stable bundles where the dimension of cohomology groups jump above their expected values. For surfaces where these moduli spaces and the cohomology of general bundles are well-understood, these jumping loci can be studied precisely. In this talk we will focus on the projective plane \(\mathbb{P}^2\), and summarize recent results on cohomology jumping loci within moduli spaces of stable bundles; this work is joint with Yeqin Liu and Woohyung Lee. Time allowing, we will pose related questions, including extensions of our results to other surfaces, related questions about jumping loci, and other cycles on moduli spaces of sheaves on surfaces.

  <h3 class="title">Fantastic stacks and where you do not expect to find them</h3>
  <p class="speaker"><span class="name">Mirko Mauri</span> (<span class="affiliation">Institute of Science and Technology Austria</span>)
  <blockquote>
    For the present edition of the Stacks Project Workshop, Jason Starr has proposed the topic 'Applications of stacks to "classical" algebraic geometry'. Following this inspiration, I will present two problems about the geometry of Lagrangian fibrations that at first glance have nothing to share with stacks, but whose solution involve them. More specifically, I will show that the fundamental group of the regular locus of an irreducible symplectic variety endowed with a Lagrangian fibration is finite, and that the Hitchin fibration for an arbitrary reductive group is delta-regular. The talk is based on on-going projects with Stefano Filipazzi and Roberto Svaldi, and with Mark de Cataldo, Andres Fernandez Herrero and Roberto Fringuelli.

  <h3 class="title">The period-index conjecture for abelian threefolds</h3>
  <p class="speaker"><span class="name">Alex Perry</span> (<span class="affiliation">University of Michigan</span>)
  <blockquote>
    The period-index conjecture asks for a precise bound on one measure of complexity of a Brauer class (its index) in terms of another (its period). I will discuss joint work with James Hotchkiss which proves this conjecture for Brauer classes on abelian threefolds.

<section id="taams">
  <h3 class="title">Torsion sheaves on stacky curves</h3>
  <p class="speaker"><span class="name">Lisanne Taams</span> (<span class="affiliation">Radboud University Nijmegen</span>)
  <blockquote>
    The goal of this talk is to show that the motive of the stack of sheaves on a stacky curve is generated by the motive of the coarse space of the curve. The most challenging case is that of torsion sheaves on stacky curves, which are closely related to representations of cyclic quivers. We highlight some of the geometric constructions that lie at the hart of the proof. If there is time, we will relate this to a graded version of the Grothendieck-Springer resolution.

<section id="voegtli">
  <h3 class="title">Flop connections between minimal models for corank 1 foliations over threefolds</h3>
  <p class="speaker"><span class="name">Pascale Voegtli</span> (<span class="affiliation">University College London</span>)
  <blockquote>
    <p>In recent years the understanding of the fundamental biraItional geometry of foliations, especially on 3-folds, has been promoted by several groundbreaking works. Cascini and Spicer have extended most parts of the classical MMP to threefold pairs equipped with a mildly singular corank 1 foliation. In particular, the existence of log-flips has been demonstrated.
    <p>The successful establishment of a foliated analogue of the classical MMP in low dimensions naturally raises the question whether classical results being closely related to the MMP do find their natural generalizations to foliated pairs.
    <p>One such classical result one might strive to convey to foliations is the well-known theorem of Kawamata from 2007, stating that two minimal models with terminal singularities are related by a sequence of flops.
    <p>In the talk, after having introduced the relevant notions, we will sketch a proof of an analogue of Kawamata's theorem for foliated 3-folds. This is recent joint work with Jiao.
